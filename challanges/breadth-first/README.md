### Breadth First Traversal
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input.

### Challenge
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach, and return a list of the values in the tree in the order they were encountered.

### Approach & Efficiency
breadthFirst - O(n)
### API
breadthFirst - traverses a binary tree using a breadth first approach and outputs a list of the values.
