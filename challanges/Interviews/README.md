## Challenge Description
in this challage we write teo function 
the first one we have array of arrays we need to do the sumation of inner arr in each index and push them in anew array
the secand one we want to do Fibonacci Sequence of any input 

## Approach & Efficiency
the jest is not install
I have issues in npm install
## Solution
* function 1 (sumation)
1. write func call sumationArr have input of arr of arrays
2. looping through the outerarr and inner arr
3. do the sumation 
4. push it in empty arr 

* function 2 (Fibonacci) 
1. write func have one parameter of target value 
2. daclaring the first two values 
3. declaring the counter that will do Fibonacci 
4. do while loop 
5. do the mathmatical equation for Fibonacci thrn return the value
