# Singly Linked List
I write node.js and it's test to decllaring the value and next to cearte it uthomaticaly and use it in linked list 
then I do linked-li.js for insert method and includes method 

## Challenge
- the consepet of linked list is steel not clear to me 
- to understand the method it self 
- write the test for the method ,If i didn't search in google of the consptes I can't write them

## Approach & Efficiency
this challang is took time because the conspet it was not clear to me in the beggening 

=======
## Code Challenge 5 & 6
## API 
insert () : to add a new node at the head of the list -----> O(1)
include() : it's return true/false depend on checking if the value is exist/found in the list or not ----> O(n)
toString() : to print out the value of list as string -----> O(n)
append() : to add a new node in the end of the list ------> O(1)
insertAfter () : add a new node after spicific node in the list ------> O(n)
insertBefore () : add a new node before spicific node in the list ------> O(n)
## I write sammary for each linked list proparty in whiteBourd 

=======================================

## Code Challange 7 - nthFromEnd 

### summary
- wwe have input k that return the node value.
- so k will start from the end of linkedlist then wake as number
## Approach & Efficiency
it's need time to llnow the conspte

## API
nthFromEnd () : 
1. calculate the length of linked list
2. we need counter to callculate the list length
3. we have three stution if it < 0 or negative value or equal 1 or counter - k to callculate it
