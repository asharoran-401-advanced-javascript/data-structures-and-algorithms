# Singly Linked List
I write node.js and it's test to decllaring the value and next to cearte it uthomaticaly and use it in linked list 
then I do linked-li.js for insert method and includes method 

## Challenge
- the consepet of linked list is steel not clear to me 
- to understand the method it self 
- write the test for the method ,If i didn't search in google of the consptes I can't write them

## Approach & Efficiency
this challang is took time because the conspet it was not clear to me 

## API
insert () : to add a new node at the head of the list
include() : it's return true/false depend on checking if the value is exist/found in the list or not 

====================================================== 

## Code Challange 7 - nthFromEnd 

### summary
- wwe have input k that return the node value.
- so k will start from the end of linkedlist then wake as number
## Approach & Efficiency
it's need time to llnow the conspte

## API

nthFromEnd () : 
1. calculate the length of linked list
2. we need counter to callculate the list length
3. then we can use this equation (lengrh - k +1)
