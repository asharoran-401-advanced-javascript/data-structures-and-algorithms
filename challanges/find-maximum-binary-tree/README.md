# Challenge Summary
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.



## Approach & Efficiency
O(n) : beacuse we do search in our array and push it in the array then sort it from lower o higher value then return thr pop array 

## Solution
we do search in the array 
our array and push it in the array then sort it from lower o higher value then return thr pop array
