# Challenge Summary
Merge sort uses a divide and conquer approach to sort data. It begins by breaking up the data set into two halves. It then uses recursion to continue to divide each half until it reaches a point in which it has individual data points (steps 1-3 in diagram). At that point the it begins to compare the values and merge them back together in the correct order (steps 4-6 in diagram).
## Approach & Efficiency
- Time: O(n log n)

- Space: O(n)
